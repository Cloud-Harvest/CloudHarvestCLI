# publish.sh
# This script is used to build, test, and publish a Docker image for the Cloud Harvest API.
# It fetches the version number from meta.json and uses it along with the git commit's short name to tag the Docker image.
# The script also checks that all commits have been pushed to git and that the current branch is main.
# If the --dry-run or --skip-git-check flags are provided, the script will perform all steps except pushing the Docker image to the Docker registry and checking git status respectively.
# After pushing the Docker image to the Docker registry, the script tags the image as latest and pushes this tag to the Docker registry.
# The Docker namespace is configurable via the docker_namespace variable.
#
# Usage:
# ./publish.sh [--dry-run] [--skip-git-check]
#
# Options:
# --dry-run: Perform all steps except pushing the Docker image to the Docker registry.
# --skip-git-check: Skip the checks for the main branch and that all commits have been pushed.
#
# Environment Variables:
# image_name: The name of the Docker image. Default is "cloud-harvest-cli".
# docker_namespace: The Docker namespace where the Docker image will be pushed. Default is "fionajuneleathers".
#
# Note: This script requires Docker, git, and grep to be installed and properly configured on the system where it will be run.
